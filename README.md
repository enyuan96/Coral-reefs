# Coral-reefs
Readme:
Project objective:
The impact of tropical cyclones from Carins to Brisbane coast on coral reefs

Data:
I use the IBTrACS version 4 dataset from the National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration. It is mainly composed of SID, basin, name, longitude, and latitude.

I also use the eReefs model from the NCL THREDDS server. lt has included temperature, salinity, and currents.

This project uses the weekly dataset with the following variables:

salinity (practical salinity unit)
temperature (degrees Celcius)
geostrophic zonal velocity from thermal wind equation (meters per second)
geostrophic meridional velocity from thermal wind equation (meters per second)

Planned analysis:
Figure 1 shows the area covered by three different typhoons.
Figure 2 Distribution of coral reefs
Figure 3 compares the temperature changes in the coral reef area passed by the typhoon (before, during, and after)
Figure 4 compares the salinity changes in the coral reef area passed by the typhoon (before, during, and after)
Figure 5 Changes in ocean currents in the coral reef area passed by the typhoon (before, when, and after)
